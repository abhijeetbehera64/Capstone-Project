     In recent years, job portals have emerged as the primary medium for job seekers to search and apply for jobs. The market for job portals
     is growing rapidly due to the increasing number of job seekers and employers using digital platforms for their job search and hiring
     processes. Job portal project is designed to help job seekers find relevant job openings based on their skills, qualifications,
      and other criteria. <br /> <br />

      and also for job seekers to apply jobs directly through this portal.
